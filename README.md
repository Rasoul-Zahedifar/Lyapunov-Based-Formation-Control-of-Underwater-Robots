# Lyapunov-Based-Formation-Control-of-Underwater-Robots
Explore advanced AUV control methods for underwater exploration. Novel Lyapunov-based tracking and dynamic formation control enhance navigation and collaboration. Addressing nonlinear dynamics, stability analyzed with practical efficiency demonstrated in diverse scenarios.
This research presents an innovative Lyapunov-based methodology for the dynamic formation control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) while simultaneously tracking reference trajectories within a nonlinear dynamical system framework. The research commences by establishing the mathematical equations governing the AUV system. Subsequently, meticulously designed reference trajectories are generated for the leader AUV. To enable the leader robot to closely follow these trajectories, a feedback kinematic controller is introduced, ensuring asymptotic convergence. Further, a dynamic control law is devised to compute the requisite actuator torques for the leader AUV, facilitating effective maneuvering.

The investigation extends to the coordination of a group of AUVs through a formation control procedure. This procedure guarantees that the follower AUVs maintain a desired spatial configuration relative to the leader AUV while concurrently tracking the established reference trajectories. The stability analysis of the proposed method encompasses considerations for kinematic, dynamic, and formation controllers, employing the Lyapunov theory. The robustness and efficacy of the developed formation control algorithm are substantiated through a series of comprehensive case studies. These studies involve diverse formations, accounting for parametric uncertainties and external disturbances, providing conclusive evidence of the algorithm's effectiveness in tracking reference trajectories under varying conditions.
